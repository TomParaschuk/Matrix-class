# Matrix-class
Python matrix class

This project is intended to expand my knowledge of Python and GitHub, as well as algorithms and recursion.
It consists of a matrix class to perform many operations in linear algebra, and has determinant and adding and subtracting 
operations so far.
Short-term goals are for me to understand how to use GitHub to review previous versions, as well as implement more
functionality like row-reducing a matrix, Crammer's Rule and finding Eigenvectors.
A long-term goal is for me to delve into algorithmic efficiency to make various processes run in the best time possible.
